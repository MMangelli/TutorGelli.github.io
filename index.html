                    enhancing user experience and facilitating seamless collaboration in 
                    various digital platforms. By allowing users to upload common file formats such as documents,

                    effortlessly exchange important documents, share visual content, and collaborate on projects without
                    compatibility issues. Additionally, supporting basic file types ensures that individuals with different
